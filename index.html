                    <p>My name is Marcia Adler.  I am a former consultant, living in NYC, who is looking to make a career change into tech. I am learning to code so I can become a softtware engineer and work on projects that help bring a company's vision to life.
                    </p>
                    <p>Prior to attending the Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp, I worked as a consultant in the area of human capital, working on transformatons and M&A projects.  I worked for a large consulting firm, as well as an internal consultant for a global organization.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have an MBA in Finance and Human Capital from the University of Connecticut.  I also have a Bachelors in Business and Technology from UConn.
                    </p>
                    <p>I enjoy solving problems and working with others to help organization achieve their goals.  Once I graduate I would like to work for an organization, potentially a startup, helping bring their vision, and products, to life using the coding skills I have gained in the Boot camp.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>When I'm not working or studying, I have a cat at home, named Princess, who is the sweetest thing.  I also love spending time with my family and friends.  I also love to travel and explore new places.  I have spent time living in Spain, Costa Rica and Hawaii.  I have also traveled to several other states and countries for both pleasure and business.  During my time as a consultant, I traveled to Germany and Canada, as well as to several different states in the US for work.  In addition to travel, I enjoy cooking and trying new recipes in the kitchen.
